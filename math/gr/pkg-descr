GR is a universal framework for cross-platform visualization applications. It
offers developers a compact, portable and consistent graphics library for
their programs. Applications range from publication quality 2D graphs to the
representation of complex 3D scenes.

GR is essentially based on an implementation of a Graphical Kernel System (GKS)
. As a self-contained system it can quickly and easily be integrated into
existing applications (i.e. using the ctypes mechanism in Python or ccall in
Julia).

The GR framework can be used in imperative programming systems or integrated
into modern object-oriented systems, in particular those based on GUI
toolkits. GR is characterized by its high interoperability and can be used
with modern web technologies. The GR framework is especially suitable for
real-time or signal processing environments.
